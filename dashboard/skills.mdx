title: "Skills"
description: "Add specialized capabilities to your AI agent using the agentskills.io specification."
---

## Overview

Skills give your AI agent specialized knowledge and workflows. They follow the open [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) specification using SKILL.md files with YAML frontmatter.

When a user's request matches a skill's purpose, the agent automatically activates it to get detailed instructions.

## Adding a Skill

Skills are added through the agent detail page:

1. Go to **Agents** and click an agent
2. On the **Skills** tab, click **Add New Skill**
3. Choose a source:
   - **Custom** - Write SKILL.md content directly
   - **URL** - Import from a GitHub raw URL

The skill is added to the project pool and assigned to the agent. Other agents can then assign the same skill from their Skills tab.

See [Agents](/dashboard/agents) for more on resource assignment.

## SKILL.md Format

```yaml
---
name: pdf-processing
description: Extracts text and tables from PDF files, fills PDF forms, and merges multiple PDFs.
metadata:
  version: "1.0.0"
  author: "Astralform"
---

# PDF Processing

Instructions for the AI agent on how to handle PDF files...

## Extracting Text

1. First, check if the file is a valid PDF
2. Use the appropriate extraction method based on content type
...
```

### Required Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphens allowed) |
| `description` | Short description shown to the agent (~100 tokens) |

### Optional Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `metadata.version` | Semantic version (e.g., "1.0.0") |
| `metadata.author` | Skill author name |

## How Skills Work

1. **Discovery** - At agent startup, skill metadata (name + description) is loaded
2. **System Prompt** - Available skills are listed in the agent's context
3. **Activation** - Agent calls `activate_skill` when a request matches
4. **Instructions** - Full SKILL.md content is provided to the agent

```
User: "Extract the tables from this PDF"

Agent: [Sees pdf-processing skill matches]
       [Calls activate_skill("pdf-processing")]
       [Receives full instructions]
       [Follows the skill's workflow]
```

## Managing Skills

### Enable/Disable

Toggle skills on/off without deleting them. Disabled skills are not shown to agents.

### Refresh URL Skills

For skills imported from URLs:

1. Click **Refresh** to re-fetch the latest content
2. Review changes in the skill editor
3. Content updates automatically

### Delete

1. Click the **Delete** button
2. Confirm deletion

<Warning>
  Deleting a skill removes it permanently. Consider disabling instead.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Write clear, actionable instructions | Include irrelevant background |
| Keep descriptions under 100 tokens | Write essay-length descriptions |
| Use step-by-step workflows | Assume agent knows procedures |
| Test skills with real requests | Deploy untested skills |
