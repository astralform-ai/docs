## Overview

Connectors let you integrate third-party services into your AI agents. Unlike MCP servers (which run server-side with your credentials), connectors support **end-user authentication** - each user connects their own account via OAuth or API key.

| Feature | MCP Servers | Connectors |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Auth model | Developer credentials | End-user OAuth/API keys |
| Runs on | Backend (stdio/SSE) | Backend (API proxy) |
| Use case | Databases, internal APIs | User-facing services (Slack, Notion) |
| Setup | Command + env vars | OAuth app or API key |

## Connector Types

### OAuth Connectors

OAuth connectors (Slack, Notion, GitHub) require you to create a dedicated OAuth app with the service provider. End users then authenticate through the standard OAuth flow.

**Setup requirements:**
- OAuth Client ID
- OAuth Client Secret
- Redirect URI configured in the provider's app settings

### API Key Connectors

API key connectors use a single API key for all requests. The key is encrypted and stored securely.

**Setup requirements:**
- Service API key

### Remote MCP Connectors

Remote MCP connectors connect to external MCP servers over HTTP. No additional credentials are needed beyond the server URL.

## Available Connectors

| Connector | Type | Category | Tools |
|-----------|------|----------|-------|
| Slack | OAuth | Communication | `slack_list_channels`, `slack_send_message`, `slack_search_messages` |
| Notion | OAuth | Productivity | `notion_search`, `notion_get_page`, `notion_create_page` |
| GitHub | OAuth | Development | `github_list_repos`, `github_search_issues` |

## Enabling a Connector

### Via Dashboard

1. Go to **Project Settings > Connectors**
2. Click **Enable** on a connector
3. Enter the required credentials
4. Configure auth settings (allow end-user auth, require auth)
5. Click **Save**

### Via Claude Code Plugin

```
/astralform-enable-connector
```

Or use natural language:

```
Enable Slack connector for my project
```

### Via MCP Tool

```
astralform_enable_connector with project_id, connector_slug="slack",
  oauth_client_id="...", oauth_client_secret="..."
```

## Setting Up OAuth Apps

### Slack

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Click **Create New App** > **From scratch**
3. Add redirect URI: `https://api.astralform.ai/v1/connectors/oauth/callback`
4. Under **OAuth & Permissions**, add required scopes:
   - `channels:read` - List channels
   - `chat:write` - Send messages
   - `search:read` - Search messages
5. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### Notion

1. Go to [notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. Click **New integration**
3. Select **Public integration**
4. Add redirect URI: `https://api.astralform.ai/v1/connectors/oauth/callback`
5. Copy the **OAuth client ID** and **OAuth client secret**

### GitHub

1. Go to [github.com/settings/developers](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2. Click **New OAuth App**
3. Set callback URL: `https://api.astralform.ai/v1/connectors/oauth/callback`
4. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

## End-User Authentication

When a connector is enabled with `require_auth: true` (default), end users must authenticate before the agent can use connector tools.

The authentication flow:
1. Agent calls a connector tool (e.g., `slack_list_channels`)
2. If user hasn't authenticated, the SDK presents an OAuth prompt
3. User authorizes access in their browser
4. Token is stored encrypted for future requests
5. Agent retries the tool call with the user's token

## Managing Connectors

### List Project Connectors

View all enabled connectors and their status:

```
/astralform-connectors
```

### Update Configuration

Update credentials, scopes, or auth settings:

```
astralform_update_project_connector with project_id, connector_id,
  oauth_scopes="channels:read,chat:write"
```

### Disable a Connector

Removing a connector also revokes all end-user tokens:

```
astralform_disable_connector with project_id, connector_id
```

<Warning>
  Disabling a connector **permanently revokes all end-user tokens**. Users will need to re-authenticate if the connector is re-enabled.
</Warning>

## Assigning to Agents

Connectors can be assigned to specific agents in multi-agent setups:

1. Go to **Agents** and click an agent
2. On the **Connectors** tab, assign available connectors
3. Only assigned connectors' tools will be available to that agent

## Security Best Practices

| Practice | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Dedicated OAuth apps | Create separate OAuth apps per project, not shared |
| Minimum scopes | Request only the permissions your agent needs |
| Rotate credentials | Periodically rotate client secrets and API keys |
| Separate environments | Use different OAuth apps for dev and production |
| Monitor usage | Check token usage in provider dashboards |

## Troubleshooting

### OAuth Flow Not Working

1. Verify redirect URI matches exactly (including trailing slash)
2. Check that OAuth client ID and secret are correct
3. Ensure the OAuth app is published/approved (some providers require this)

### Tools Not Available

1. Verify the connector is enabled (`is_enabled: true`)
2. Check that the connector is assigned to the agent
3. Ensure the user has authenticated (if `require_auth: true`)

### Token Expired

Tokens are automatically refreshed when possible. If refresh fails:
1. The user will be prompted to re-authenticate
2. Check that the OAuth app's refresh token settings are configured
