## Overview

Projects are the top-level organizational unit in Astralform. Each project has:

- Its own API keys
- LLM provider configuration
- MCP server connections
- Platform tool settings
- Conversation history

## Creating a Project

1. Go to [astralform.ai](https://astralform.ai)
2. Click **New Project** in the sidebar
3. Enter a project name
4. Click **Create**

## Project Settings

Access project settings by clicking the gear icon next to your project name.

### General

- **Project Name** - Display name for the project
- **Project ID** - Unique identifier (read-only)

### Danger Zone

- **Delete Project** - Permanently removes the project and all associated data

<Warning>
  Deleting a project cannot be undone. All conversations, API keys, and configurations will be lost.
</Warning>

## Multiple Projects

Use separate projects for:

- **Development vs Production** - Different API keys and configurations
- **Different Apps** - Each app gets its own project
- **Testing** - Isolated environment for experiments

## API Access

Each project exposes the same API endpoints, authenticated by project-specific API keys:

```bash
# All requests require the X-API-Key header
curl -X GET https://api.astralform.ai/v1/conversations \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-project-api-key"
```
