## Overview

Agents let you split your AI into specialized roles. Each agent can have its own LLM, system prompt, skills, MCP servers, and platform tools. A supervisor agent routes user messages to the right specialist automatically.

Without agents configured, your project uses a single default agent with all resources.

## Creating an Agent

1. Go to **Project Settings > Agents**
2. Click **Add Agent**
3. Fill in the details:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Name | Yes | Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphens allowed, e.g., `support-agent`) |
| Display Name | No | Human-readable name shown in UI |
| Description | No | What this agent specializes in (used for supervisor routing) |
| System Prompt | No | Custom instructions for this agent |

4. Optionally configure an agent-specific LLM (falls back to project LLM if not set)
5. Click **Create**

## Assigning Resources

Each agent gets its own subset of project resources:

### Skills

Assign specific skills to an agent so it only has access to relevant capabilities.

1. Edit the agent
2. Select skills from the project's skill pool
3. Save changes

### MCP Servers

Assign MCP servers so the agent only uses relevant external tools.

1. Edit the agent
2. Select MCP servers from the project pool
3. Save changes

### Platform Tools

Assign platform tools (e.g., web search) per agent.

1. Edit the agent
2. Select tools from available platform tools
3. Save changes

## Agent-Specific LLM

Each agent can override the project's LLM configuration:

1. Edit the agent
2. Set **LLM Provider** and **Model** (e.g., OpenAI / gpt-4o)
3. Add the provider API key if using a different provider than the project
4. Save changes

If no LLM is configured on the agent, it inherits the project's LLM settings.

## Default Agent

Every project can have one **default agent**. When no `agent_name` is specified in a chat request, the default agent handles it.

- The default agent cannot be deleted
- You can change which agent is default by editing agent settings

## Orchestration

Orchestration controls how multiple agents work together.

### Single (Default)

Only the default agent handles all requests. Other agents can be addressed directly by name via the SDK.

### Supervisor

A supervisor agent automatically routes user messages to the best specialist:

1. Go to **Project Settings > Agents**
2. In the **Orchestration** section, select **Supervisor**
3. Pick a supervisor agent from the dropdown
4. Save

```
User: "Help me with my billing issue"

Supervisor: [Analyzes request]
            [Routes to support-agent]

support-agent: "I'd be happy to help with your billing..."
```

The supervisor uses agent descriptions to decide routing, so write clear descriptions for each agent.

## Managing Agents

### Enable/Disable

Toggle agents on/off without deleting them:

1. Go to **Project Settings > Agents**
2. Click the toggle next to an agent

Disabled agents are excluded from routing and cannot be addressed by name.

### Delete

1. Click **Delete** on the agent card
2. Confirm deletion

<Warning>
  The default agent cannot be deleted. Deleting an agent removes all its resource assignments.
</Warning>

## SDK Integration

SDKs can discover available agents and route messages to specific ones:

```swift
// List available agents
let agents = try await astralform.getAgents()

// Send to a specific agent
try await client.streamChat(
    conversationId: "conv_123",
    message: "Review this code",
    agentName: "code-reviewer"
)
```

See the [Agents API](/api-reference/agents/list) for details.

## Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Write clear agent descriptions for routing | Leave descriptions empty |
| Assign only relevant resources to each agent | Give every agent all resources |
| Use supervisor for 3+ specialized agents | Use supervisor for a single agent |
| Test routing with different message types | Assume routing works without testing |
