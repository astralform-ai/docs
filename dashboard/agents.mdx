## Overview

Agents are the central building block in Astralform. Every project has a **Main Agent** that handles all requests by default. You can create additional specialized agents and use a supervisor to route messages automatically.

All configuration — LLM provider, skills, MCP servers, and platform tools — is managed through agent detail pages.

## Main Agent

Every project starts with a **Main Agent**. It auto-inherits all project resources (skills, MCP servers, tools), so single-agent setups require no extra configuration.

- The Main Agent cannot be deleted
- New resources added to the project are automatically available to the Main Agent
- When no `agent_name` is specified in a chat request, the Main Agent handles it

## Agent Detail Page

Click any agent from the agents list to open its detail page. Configuration is organized into four tabs:

### Model Tab

Configure the LLM provider and model for this agent.

1. Go to **Agents** and click an agent
2. On the **Model** tab, select a provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Ollama)
3. Choose a model and enter the provider API key
4. Click **Save**

If no LLM is configured on a named agent, it inherits the project's LLM settings from the Main Agent.

See [LLM Providers](/dashboard/llm-providers) for provider details and available models.

### Skills Tab

Assign skills so the agent has access to specialized capabilities.

1. On the **Skills** tab, see assigned and available skills
2. Click **Assign** to add a skill, or **Unassign** to remove one
3. Click **Add New Skill** to create a skill and assign it in one step

For the Main Agent, all project skills are auto-assigned.

See [Skills](/dashboard/skills) for the SKILL.md format and best practices.

### MCP Tab

Assign MCP servers so the agent can use external tools and databases.

1. On the **MCP** tab, see assigned and available servers
2. Click **Assign** or **Unassign** to manage assignments
3. Click **Add New Server** to create and assign a server

For the Main Agent, all project MCP servers are auto-assigned.

See [MCP Servers](/dashboard/mcp-servers) for server configuration and examples.

### Tools Tab

Assign platform tools (e.g., web search) to the agent.

1. On the **Tools** tab, see assigned and available tools
2. Toggle tools on or off for this agent

For the Main Agent, all project tools are auto-assigned.

See [Platform Tools](/dashboard/platform-tools) for available tools.

## Creating an Agent

1. Go to **Agents**
2. Click **Add Agent**
3. Fill in the details:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Name | Yes | Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphens allowed, e.g., `support-agent`) |
| Display Name | No | Human-readable name shown in UI |
| Description | No | What this agent specializes in (used for supervisor routing) |
| System Prompt | No | Custom instructions for this agent |

4. Click **Create**, then configure the agent via its detail page

## Orchestration

Orchestration controls how multiple agents work together.

### Single (Default)

Only the Main Agent handles all requests. Other agents can be addressed directly by name via the SDK.

### Supervisor

A supervisor agent automatically routes user messages to the best specialist:

1. Go to **Agents**
2. In the **Orchestration** section, select **Supervisor**
3. Pick a supervisor agent from the dropdown
4. Save

```
User: "Help me with my billing issue"

Supervisor: [Analyzes request]
            [Routes to support-agent]

support-agent: "I'd be happy to help with your billing..."
```

The supervisor uses agent descriptions to decide routing, so write clear descriptions for each agent.

## Managing Agents

### Enable/Disable

Toggle agents on/off without deleting them. Disabled agents are excluded from routing and cannot be addressed by name.

### Delete

Click **Delete** on an agent card and confirm.

<Warning>
  The Main Agent cannot be deleted. Deleting an agent removes all its resource assignments.
</Warning>

## SDK Integration

SDKs can discover available agents and route messages to specific ones:

```swift
// List available agents
let agents = try await astralform.getAgents()

// Send to a specific agent
try await client.streamChat(
    conversationId: "conv_123",
    message: "Review this code",
    agentName: "code-reviewer"
)
```

See the [Agents API](/api-reference/agents/list) for details.

## Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Write clear agent descriptions for routing | Leave descriptions empty |
| Assign only relevant resources to each agent | Give every agent all resources |
| Use supervisor for 3+ specialized agents | Use supervisor for a single agent |
| Test routing with different message types | Assume routing works without testing |
