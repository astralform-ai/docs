## Overview

API keys authenticate requests from your iOS app to Astralform. Each project can have multiple API keys for different environments or purposes.

## Generating an API Key

1. Open your project in the dashboard
2. Go to **Settings > API Keys**
3. Click **Generate New Key**
4. Copy the key immediately - it won't be shown again

<Warning>
  API keys are shown only once when created. Store them securely.
</Warning>

## Key Format

API keys follow this format:
```
af_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

- `af_` - Astralform prefix
- `live_` - Environment (live or test)
- `xxxx...` - Random identifier

## Using API Keys

Include the key in all API requests:

```swift
let client = AstralformClient(
    baseURL: URL(string: "https://api.astralform.ai")!,
    apiKey: "af_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
)
```

Or in raw HTTP requests:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.astralform.ai/v1/chat/stream \
  -H "X-API-Key: af_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"conversation_id": "...", "message": "Hello"}'
```

## Rotating Keys

To rotate a key without downtime:

1. Generate a new key
2. Update your app to use the new key
3. Deploy the updated app
4. Delete the old key

## Revoking Keys

If a key is compromised:

1. Go to **Settings > API Keys**
2. Find the compromised key
3. Click **Revoke**
4. Generate a new key and update your app

## Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Store keys in secure storage (Keychain) | Hardcode keys in source code |
| Use different keys per environment | Share keys across projects |
| Rotate keys regularly | Commit keys to version control |
| Revoke unused keys | Leave old keys active |

## Rate Limits

API keys have the following default limits:

| Plan | Requests/min | Requests/day |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| Free | 60 | 1,000 |
| Pro | 300 | 50,000 |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom |
