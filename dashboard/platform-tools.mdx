## Overview

Platform tools are pre-built capabilities that run on Astralform's backend. Enable them with a single click - no MCP server configuration needed.

## Available Tools

Web search powered by Tavily AI.

**Capabilities:**
- Real-time web search
- News search
- Answer extraction

**Configuration:**
1. Go to **Project Settings > Platform Tools**
2. Enable **Tavily Search**
3. Enter your Tavily API key (get one at [tavily.com](https://tavily.com))

**Example Usage:**
```
User: What's the latest news about AI?

```

## Enabling Platform Tools

1. Go to **Project Settings > Platform Tools**
2. Find the tool you want to enable
3. Toggle it **On**
4. Enter any required API keys
5. Click **Save**

## Tool Behavior

Platform tools are automatically invoked by the AI when relevant. You don't need to explicitly request them.

### How the AI Decides

1. User asks a question
2. AI analyzes if tools would help
3. If web search is needed, AI calls `tavily_search`
4. Results are incorporated into the response

### Controlling Tool Usage

You can guide tool usage through system prompts:

```
Always search the web for current information when asked about:
- News and events
- Prices and availability
- Weather and forecasts
```

## API Key Management

Platform tool API keys are stored securely and never exposed to clients.

**To update a key:**
1. Go to **Project Settings > Platform Tools**
2. Click the edit icon next to the tool
3. Enter the new API key
4. Click **Save**

## Cost Considerations

| Tool | Cost Model |
|------|------------|
| Tavily Search | Per search query |

Monitor usage in **Project Settings > Analytics**.
