## Overview

The plugin uses OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Flow - a secure method designed for CLI tools that can't open a browser directly.

## Login

Run the login command:

```
/astralform-login
```

You'll see output like:

```
To authenticate, visit: https://astralform.ai/device

Enter code: ABCD-1234

Waiting for authorization...
```

## Authorize

1. Open the URL in your browser
2. Log in to your Astralform account (or create one)
3. Enter the code shown in your terminal
4. Click **Authorize**

The plugin will automatically detect when you've authorized and store your credentials.

## Credentials Storage

Tokens are stored locally at:

```
~/.astralform/credentials.json
```

<Warning>
  Never commit this file to version control. It's automatically added to `.gitignore`.
</Warning>

## Token Refresh

The plugin automatically refreshes expired tokens. If you encounter auth errors, run `/astralform-login` again.

## Logout

To clear your credentials:

```bash
rm ~/.astralform/credentials.json
```

## Verify Authentication

Check your logged-in identity:

```
Who am I on Astralform?
```

Claude will use the `astralform_whoami` tool to show your email and account details.
